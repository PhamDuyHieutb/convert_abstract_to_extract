WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, accepting endorsements from hundreds of Latino leaders, warned Tuesday that Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the GOP's opposition to census sampling and Texas Gov. George Bush's education proposals could wipe out economic gains made by Hispanics under administration policies. Gore's warnings came as his presidential campaign launched "Ganamos con Gore" ("We win with Gore"), a nationwide effort to build on the political organizations of the nearly 600 Hispanic elected officials and community leaders who endorsed the vice president Tuesday. Gore said federal tax credit payments to the poor have been the "single most beneficial economic change" for Hispanics and other working poor families over the last two decades. But he noted that House Republicans are considering plans to delay billions of dollars in those tax credit payments in order to pay for other federal spending and to help finance a tax cut that Gore described as "risky" to the current economic expansion. The vice president also said GOP-sponsored tax cuts could lead to reductions in federal aid to education. And while he did not mention Bush by name, he noted that "some Republican candidates stand and pretend to support public education while at the same time supporting this risky tax scheme that would devastate public education in this country." He also criticized the kind of education policy recently outlined by Bush, in which federal dollars would be diverted from failing public schools to private schools that are not required to admit all students. "It's the strangest education I've ever seen because they are claiming they can add by subtracting and dividing," he said. Gore also questioned how any GOP presidential candidate could stand by the efforts of House Republicans to stop the Census Bureau from using statistical sampling in order to avoid the kind of undercounting of minorities that has occurred in the last two census counts. "How can anyone look at the extra problems and challenges facing the Latino community and come to the conclusion that ... they cannot support a fair and accurate census," Gore said. "I don't think anyone can claim to be a friend of the Latino community while simultaneously supporting an approach to the census which is designed to intentionally undercount Latinos." The Hispanic community, which is expected to become the largest ethnic minority in the country by 2005, is keenly interested in the 2000 census. The population count is used in the funding formulas of nearly every federal program. The Hispanic endorsements of Gore may have taken some of the sting out of the decision by Friends of the Earth, an influential environmental group, to back former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's sole competitor for the 2000 Democratic presidential campaign. Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., a senior member of the Democratic leadership in Congress, called Bradley, his fellow New Jerseyite, a "great guy" as he introduced Gore to the Hispanic leaders who crowded into a Capitol Hill hotel room for the "Ganamos con Gore" event. But in reminding the crowd that Gore has stood against Republican initiatives that were widely viewed as anti-immigrant in the Hispanic community since the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994, Menendez asked, "Where were those who want our votes now who should have been at our side defending us then?" Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996, briefly mulled an independent run for president, then spent time lecturing at Stanford University in California before deciding to challenge Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination. Menendez also lashed out at Bush, the overwhelming favorite to win the 2000 GOP presidential nomination, suggesting that the Texan's campaign signature of "compassionate conservatism" insults Hispanics. "Our community doesn't need compassion _ even talking to us in that way treats us as a stepchild," he said. "We don't need compassion, we need educational opportunity ... health care security (and) access to capital." California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a longtime Gore booster, used Bush to whip up the enthusiasm of the crowd. "I don't get it. What's all this talk about George Bush and the Latino community? They talk about this guy like he's Ricky Martin or something. Anybody who thinks that George W. Bush is good for Latinos _ they are living la vie da loca." He added: "I think he's just a little bit more sizzle than he is steak." ENDIT Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
