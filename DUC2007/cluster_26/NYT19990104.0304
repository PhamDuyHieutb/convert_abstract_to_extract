WASHINGTON _ Jose Villarreal, the San Antonio lawyer serving as treasurer of Vice President Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, said Monday that he will work to make sure the Gore campaign's fund raising complies with the "letter and spirit" of the law. Villarreal, a partner in the San Antonio office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, began his part-time duties as Gore's campaign treasurer on Jan. 1. He said he will "assemble the resources necessary to wage this campaign and do so in an expeditious manner." Villarreal said he will supervise Gore's fund raising "in a manner that fully complies with both the letter and spirit of the law," adding: "We'll make certain to do that. As treasurer, I'll do everything within my power to insure that happens." Gore's fund raising in the 1996 re-election campaign of President Clinton came under scrutiny of Congress and the Justice Department. Attorney General Janet Reno later cleared Gore of any wrong doing. Villarreal, a graduate of Purdue University and the Indiana University school of law, served as deputy campaign manager for the 1988 Democratic presidential campaign of former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and as deputy campaign manger for the 1992 Democratic presidential campaign of then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. He also served as associate director of Clinton's White House office of presidential personnel. Serving as treasurer is a "new area of responsibility for me," Villarreal said in an interview Monday. "I have never been involved in this capacity before. It's new." Villarreal will be legally responsible for the Gore campaign's filings with the Federal Election Commission. Villarreal said he wanted to work for Gore's election as president because Gore has worked in concert with Clinton to lead "one of the greatest peacetime economies" in American history. Craig Smith, the former White House political director who now heads Gore's presidential campaign, said Villarreal was chosen for the assignment as treasurer because he has extensive experience in national politics, "he's well respected nationally and he's a big political player in Texas and the country as a whole."
