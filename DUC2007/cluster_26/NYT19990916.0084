On the eve of his 59th trip to California, Vice President Al Gore has released a list of new endorsements for his 2000 presidential bid from state congressional leaders _ including U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Gore's campaign had been the target of recent criticism from GOP leaders saying he lacks the thick roster of endorsements compiled by Republican front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush. But his two-day trip beginning Thursday, to include stops in Los Angeles, Fresno and San Francisco, is designed in part to showcase the formal endorsement of Gov. Gray Davis _ who will tour California with him _ as well as other state Democratic leaders. Gore will speak to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, visit a public high school and speak to labor leaders during his state trip. Among the members of the California Democratic congressional delegation who announced their formal endorsements of Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday were Lois Capps of Santa Barbara, Gary Condit of Modesto, Julian Dixon of Los Angeles, Bob Filner of Chula Vista, Tom Lantos of San Mateo, Barbara Lee of Oakland, Bob Matsui of Sacramento, Ellen Tauscher of Walnut Creek and Mike Thompson of Napa. "It shows they have seen the type of leadership that Al Gore has brought to this country and ... the working families of California," said Gore spokesman Roger Salazar Wednesday. "They recognize the vice president has a serious commitment to standing up for the issues that are important to the people of California _ and he'll continue to do so as president." Gore has previously won the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, as well as state Democratic U.S. Reps. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles, Howard Berman of Mission Hills, Cal Dooly of Hanford, Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, Matthew Martinez of Alhambra, Juanita Millender-McDonald of Torrance, Grace Napolitano of Norwalk and Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles. Feinstein has long expressed her support of Gore's 2000 presidential bid, but made her endorsement formal Wednesday. "Vice President Al Gore has demonstrated time and time again he is dedicated to the people of the United States _ be it reducing gun violence, protecting our environment, bolstering patients rights, safeguarding a woman's right to choose or reforming public education," said Feinstein in a statement released Wednesday. She lauded Gore as "a leader with a proven record of fighting on our behalf," saying, "He has also demonstrated a strong commitment to my home state of California _ helping our schools, funding job programs, &LR; and promoting the development of high-tech industries that have fueled our economic growth." &LR;
