AUTISTIC-ADULTS-MED _ Support services for people with autism -- children and adults alike -- fall far short of fulfilling their needs today, says a new study. And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside their family homes, the researchers say. SHOES-MAGNETS-MED _ Florsheim says its magnet-laden shoes can ease pain and make your legs and back less tired. But a California consumer group is not just taking issue with these claims; it is suing the company for touting them as remedies. The Consumer Justice Center, a nonprofit consumer protection group, filed the suit last week in Orange County and asks that Florsheim stop advertising the MagneForce shoes as a health aid and refund the purchase price (about $122 plus tax) to people who bought the shoes. COCAINE-ACUPUNCTURE-MED _ Cocaine addicts looking to get clean may want to turn to needles for help. A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is an effective treatment for cocaine abuse. The finding gives the ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine, experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study from a major American medical school. A report on the finding appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine. CONSTIPATION-HISTORY-MED _ Here's a history topic you don't see with much regularity: constipation. That's right, to the annals of medical history comes the complete archival guide to the most basic of bodily functions. And why not, says James Whorton, author of "Inner Hygiene," just published by Oxford University Press. "For centuries, there has been a strong intuitive feeling that regularity is essential for health, and because constipation is a topic that affects just about all of us at one time or another, it's always received a lot of attention," says Whorton, a professor of medical history at the University of Washington in Seattle. BRAIN-OSTEOARTHRITIS-MED _ In their efforts to better understand the nature of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis, researchers are setting their sights a bit higher -- on the brain. Osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease of the soft and bony tissues, is the most common type of arthritis, affecting weight-bearing joints that include the knee and hip. The pain is unique, doctors say, because it can be so prolonged and difficult to manage. ----- ABOUT HEALTHSCOUT: HealthScout (http://www.healthscout.com) is a service of Rx Remedy, Inc., a leader in the field of health information and publisher of REMEDY Magazine, a prize-winning health publication read in 2.2 American homes. -- All of HealthScout's original stories are based on primary sources: reports in refereed medical journals and interviews with the medical researchers who authored them.
