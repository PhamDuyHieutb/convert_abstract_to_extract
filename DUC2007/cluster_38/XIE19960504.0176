BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Thai Chamber of Commerce will meet Peru's gold industry leaders to discuss possible joint ventures to mine Peruvian gold, the Bangkok post reported today. Patima Srichoomsiri, director of the Chamber's committee on small and medium-sized enterprises, will visit the Peruvian capital Lima at the head of a delegation next week and attend Peru's Second International Gold Symposium there. A press release from the Peruvian Embassy in Bangkok said the gold mining industry has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, prompting Peru's National Mining and Petroleum Society to organize the first international gold symposium in 1994. That meeting drew more than 800 participants. Next week's symposium will highlight the current state of gold resources in the country and promote new investment in the industry.
