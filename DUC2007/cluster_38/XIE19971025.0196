SAN JOSE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central American countries and Canada signed here today an agreement on rules for a clear environment for the mining industry in Central America. A communique issued afterwards said that in the future both the Central American countries and Canada will take into account the need of sustainable development when developing their mining industry. Several Canadian firms have shown interest in investing in mining activities in Costa Rica and other Central American countries, mainly in gold exploitation. But such projects have met opposition because of the undesirable effect they could have on environment.
