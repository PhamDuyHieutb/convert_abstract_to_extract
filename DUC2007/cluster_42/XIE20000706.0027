In a final report issued Thursday on last year's July 19 crash of the aircraft near Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State, the United States,the NTSB said Kennedy, son of the late U.S. president, had become disorientated during a descent over water at night. Killed were Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette. The crash probably occurred because of "the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night," the report said. Kennedy's piloting difficulties were likely to have been caused by "spatial disorientation," a problem when pilots lose track of the position and motion of their plane relative to the earth's surface, it added. This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of fatal aircraft accidents, according to a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration report. Investigators said they could not find any mechanical problems with Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II, and autopsies on all three victims found no abnormalities.
