NEW YORK (AP) -- When John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife died, many people wondered what had happened to the couple's dog, Friday, who was frequently seen around the city with them. The black and white dog is safe -- it was apparently taken to Massachusetts by a close friend of Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, shortly after their plane disappeared last weekend, said a law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Daily News first reported on Thursday that the dog was alive and living in Massachusetts with the couple's relatives. It was not immediately known if the Kennedys' cat was also in Massachusetts.
