ANDREWS, N.C. _ Eric Rudolph may be hiding in a cave just up the hill from this western North Carolina town that cherishes how far out in the wilderness it is. Or he may be thousands of miles away. There are about as many theories to the bombing suspect's whereabouts as there are potential hiding places. Federal law enforcement agents have searched for Rudolph since shortly after the Jan. 29, 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic. They think he's still somewhere around here, probably in an old mine within the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest. A few dozen agents live and work in Andrews, continuing what is one of the nation's longest and most chronicled manhunts. But not everyone thinks Rudolph, an experienced backwoodsman who would have just celebrated his 33rd birthday, is still hidden in these woods. "I think he's been long gone for awhile. He's not around here," said George Nordmann, during a recent interview in his Better Way Health Foods store in downtown Andrews. Nordmann said he has no inside knowledge about Rudolph, but the 72-year-old navy veteran and former citrus farmer may be the last person to have seen Rudolph. In July 1998, Rudolph took about six months' worth of supplies and a pickup truck from Nordmann. The encounter happened on a Thursday, but Nordmann did not report it to authorities for two days. The truck was found two days later near the entrance to a campground just east of here in Macon County. Nordmann gave authorities a detailed description of Rudolph. The suspect had apparently added a beard and a ponytail. The information did not lead to a quick capture. Instead, Rudolph, who is a suspect not just in the Birmingham bombing but also in three Atlanta-area bombings in 1996 and 1997 including a fatal blast at Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics, remains at large. He has survived one winter on the run, despite predictions a year ago at this time that once the leaves fell and the temperature dropped, he would be caught. Other than Rudolph's connection with Nordmann and the discovery of buried trash with the suspect's fingerprints on it, federal agents have not disclosed much about their search. With winter approaching, officials familiar with the search said that federal agents will continue to focus on the mountainous, rugged area around Macon County. The task force heading up the search has had a change in leadership in recent months. A spokesman in Atlanta said no briefings are planned to discuss any new events in the case. Will Eric Rudolph be caught? It's a question that many people here say they once were preoccupied with but now just don't care about. Rudolph, a native of the area who attended Nantahala High School, has become as much a living part of folklore as a suspect on the run. A year ago Andrews was engulfed by a national media circus as satellite TV trucks lined the streets, Hundreds of law enforcement agents saturated the area. The TV trucks are gone and so is the ostensible federal presence. Around Andrews and the small communities that lead into the mountains, the talk has turned to foliage ( a fairly spectacular season), high school football (the Brevard Blue Devils are ranked No. 2 in the state) and the tourists, who are the economic lifeblood of the region. In interviews, residents said they occasionally see agents buying fuel for their trucks. Otherwise, life goes on. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) "They used to come in here and buy the fancy fanny packs and all the other stuff they could find. We haven't seen any of them in awhile," said Mary Kelley, a clerk at the popular Nantahala Outdoor Center, which stands along the Appalachian Trail. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) It's easy to see how Rudolph might still be around. Drive a few hundred feet into the woods, look to your left or right, and you could be lost in an instant. Natives talk about hundreds, perhaps thousands, of underground caves and mines and the ability of an experienced outdoorsman to elude capture. A restaurant near Nantahala Lake, about nine miles east of Andrews, declares "Rudolph Eats Here" on its marquee. Inside, the signs proclaiming "We Survived the Rudolph Manhunt 1998. 1999? 2000?" appear likely to still apply when the calendar changes in a few months. The deer hunting season is under way. Sitting under a tree silently waiting for a target, Eric Farley said he suspected Rudolph is in the forest, maybe even close by. But Farley said he doubted searchers would find him. It makes sense for Rudolph to stay in the area, Farley said. "He doesn't know Mexico, he doesn't know the beach. He knows here, and here is a big, big place," said Farley, a Graham County resident. When Rudolph first escaped into the forest, some cheered his elusiveness and saw it as an indictment of the FBI and other federal agencies. Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of government is native to the mountains of western North Carolina. But sharing a political view only goes so far. An off-duty police officer died in the Alabama clinic bombing and a nurse was permanently maimed, and to many people, those human losses should not be forgotten in the saga of Eric Rudolph. "I'm against abortion too _ it's just wrong _ but that's the wrong way to get there," Farley said. "To me, he's just a criminal, and he broke the law, and they should catch him." The FBI has posted a $1 million reward for Rudolph's capture, and he has been placed on the agency's 10-most-wanted list. The FBI will stay in Andrews until they find Rudolph, a spokesman said. Those sentiments aren't all that pleasing to some in Andrews, who want to turn the corner. Nordmann, who operates the health food store and knew Rudolph, said he suspected the federal agents actually came to Andrews "so they could do surveillance on the militia folks out here." He's skeptical that several hundred law enforcement types would be dispatched to find just one person. The area has had recent economic setbacks and hopes are high for a strong fall tourist season. A Levi's jeans factory in Murphy just closed, and a Baker furniture plant in Andrews is leaving next summer, said Jackie Lancaster, Andrews Chamber of Commerce executive director. "Our focus is on our economic development and getting people to take a look at us to come here. At least, more so than `We have a suspected bomber in the mountains'," said Lancaster. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) As she spoke in the chamber headquarters, the five-car yellow and red Great Smoky Mountains Railroad train pulled up. Lancaster also gives out train schedules and helps with reservations. The four-hour round-trips from Andrews to the Nantahala Gorge end this month for the year, and the remaining trips are nearly filled. On a recent day, a group from Georgia boarded the 10:30 a.m. train. Most seemed intent on snapping pictures of downtown Andrews before the Great Smoky train pulled away and scribbling a few postcards. A few said they were aware of the manhunt, but several expressed no knowledge of Rudolph. Their charter bus driver, Dean Gilstrap of Gainesville, Ga., couldn't resist a bit of teasing. "I told 'em not to wander off too far or he may get 'em," drawled Gilstrap. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Living folklore legend, fugitive and mountain man, Eric Rudolph may fit all those roles. But if he is indeed in the Nantahala forest somewhere, he probably won't be spotted in downtown Andrews. He may be more likely by a creek where there's plenty of water and the trout are hefty. Contemplating the situation, Sylva resident Steve Webb said he could see how the isolation of the forest would appeal to a man on the run. Webb said he suspected Rudolph was either dead or in another country, but he keeps his eyes open _ just in case. "Heck, I'd turn him in in a heartbeat even if there wasn't a reward, but for what he did in those bombings," Webb said.
