Despite large law enforcement numbers, Rudolph still eludesBy Jennifer Brett C. 1998 Cox News Service More than 200 state, local and federal agents continued the search in the mountains of western North Carolina for Eric Robert Rudolph Sunday, but the 31-year-old suspect in the fatal Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic continued to elude his trackers. "We're going to be here until the end," Southeast Bomb Task Force spokeswoman Celeste Armstead said. "We'll be here until Eric Robert Rudolph is captured." Throughout the day, cars and trucks carrying heavily armed federal agents, search dogs and equipment rolled out of a search command post and staging area at a mountain campground east of Andrews, N.C. "We rotate people to keep them fresh," Armstead said. "We're not cutting back. We're not scaling back at all." Despite some people's assertions that they would help Rudolph or keep his whereabouts secret if they spotted him, federal officials say they are getting good cooperation from local residents. Armstead would not, however, say whether agents are any closer to capturing Rudolph. Also, areas near the search site are swamped with reporters but not too many thrill seekers, as there isn't much a vacationer's camera could capture from outside the search perimeter, officials said. Agents are keeping outsiders far from the 30 square-mile area where trackers, dogs, helicopters and sophisticated surveillance equipment are hunting for Rudolph, who is also sought for questioning about three Atlanta explosions at Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Olympics, a gay nightclub and a Sandy Springs abortion clinic.
