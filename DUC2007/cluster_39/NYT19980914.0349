It's time to cut another check for Jerry Seinfeld. In a record cable deal worth more than $100 million, TBS has purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated repeats of "Seinfeld" to begin in fall 2002 and last four years. The Atlanta-based station will reportedly pay more than $600,000 apiece for 180 "Seinfeld" episodes, eclipsing the price Lifetime earlier negotiated for cable syndication rights to Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom, "Ellen." Though a cable benchmark, the deal doesn't approach the nearly $286 million a year NBC will pay for first-run "ER" episodes for the next three seasons. But it's still a lot of cash for Seinfeld and his show's distributor, Columbia TriStar TV. Variety estimates that all `Seinfeld" syndication deals to date have bumped the show's overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion. TBS' contract will bump "Seinfeld" repeats, a big ratings booster, off WATL in metro Atlanta. WATL's pact expires in March 2001. There remains an 18-month period between that date and the start of "Seinfeld" on TBS that WATL might purchase. "'Seinfeld' is one of the three shows in history _ 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Andy Griffith Show' are the others _ to sign off at No. 1," said TBS President Bill Burke, who also recently cut deals for syndicated repeats of "Friends" (to start in 2001) and "Home Improvement" and "The Drew Carey Show" (both to start in 2002). "We're very confident of this show. We think it has legs." So far, "Seinfeld" repeats have been a strong performer, especially in metro Atlanta. The show, now most often airing at 10 o'clock weeknights on WATL, sometimes beats nearly all prime-time programming. During the May sweeps, the period stations use to set ad rates worth millions of dollars, "Seinfeld" repeats averaged nearly 185,000 metro Atlanta homes. "May was sensational," said Don Hess, WATL programming chief. But four years from now, he said, "Seinfeld" might lose its ratings heat. "That's what happened to 'Cheers."' Burke, however, thinks TBS got a deal. "'Seinfeld' is in a very small class of mega-hit shows," he said. "Networks are not producing a lot of mega-hits anymore. We think this might be one of the last and wanted to be sure it was on our schedule." Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
