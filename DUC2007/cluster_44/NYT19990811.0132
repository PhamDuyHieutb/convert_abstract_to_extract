Back then, it was a political statement; today, it's a health statement. Middle age and affluence are hitting baby boomers at the same time, benefiting the all-natural-food industry. Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets. Boomers remember granola and yogurt and herbal teas from their college hippie days. And although whole foods have long had a place with the Birkenstocks and mantra crowd, today's consumer is more likely to drive a Suburban than a VW bus. Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets. And the meaning of "natural" has morphed to include exotics: cheeses, butters and fish and varieties of vegetables we only read about 30 years ago. Older, more sophisticated shoppers want to buy Saint Johnswort, but they also want to buy triple cream St. Andre cheese. Younger shoppers who can afford it also want it both ways: hip and healthful. U.S. sales of organic and all-natural foods have grown by 15 percent to 25 percent annually for the past seven years. Today, more than 10,000 U.S. farms produce organic/natural crops and livestock, according to the Organic Farming Research Foundation. And these products are being snapped up by consumers who, in the main, make more than $50,000 a year and are 45 and older, according to SPINS, an independent natural-products information source. When Cheerios maker General Mills rolls out an organic option to all those sugar-pumped floaters, you know organic groceries are going mainstream. Sunrise Cereal slipped into the General Mills tide this summer, and it won't be the last of its kind, at least in marketing trials. The steady growth of the organic market isn't the near panic-driven demand generated in the 1980s by a string of food-safety scares that included actress Meryl Streep on "60 Minutes" challenging the use of alar, a ripening agent. That event led to near disaster for the apple industry. And although the growth of the market is consistent, organics still represent a small fraction of grocery sales in the country, at least in part because of their higher prices: Whereas an increasing organic supply has narrowed the price gap between organic and conventional fare, the difference in price remains large enough to favor higher-income shoppers. Nevertheless, grocers see a gradual greening in the diet of the American consumer. "In the last two to three years, momentum has begun to build in the organic food area," Tom Thumb spokeswoman Connie Yates said in a prepared statement. "Sales of organic foods in all categories are definitely on the increase. By the year 2001, organic products are projected to command 5 percent of total food sales in the United States." "The awareness is what's rising," said Doug White, produce director for Minyard Food Stores' three chains: Minyard, Carnival and Sack'N Save. None of the mainstream supermarkets has matched the certified-organic and all-natural inventory found at specialty stores such as Austin-based Whole Foods Markets, the nation's No. 1 natural-foods chain, or Boulder, Colo.-based Wild Oats Markets, or H.E. Butt Grocery Co.'s three Central Market stores in Austin and San Antonio. Among mainstream grocers, Tom Thumb based in Dallas was once the Metroplex leader for certified organic produce and all-natural alternatives, and Yates said its storewide organics variety has continued to expand. Albertson's, already the Metroplex leader in overall grocery market share, has more recently taken the mainstream lead for adding varieties and carrying consistent supplies. The Boise, Idaho-based chain's certified-organic and all-natural lineups include fresh produce, dried spices, canned and frozen foods, dairy items, snacks and other packaged items, and meats and poultry. And Kroger's Southwest division has been revving up its own reformation _ adding 16- to 24-foot sections devoted to certified organic produce in 44 of its 62 Metroplex supermarkets since spring 1998, said Gary Huddleston, division consumer affairs manager. Like an increasing number of competitors, Kroger is also carrying "additive-free" or "all-natural" lines of beef, chicken and pork. "Our organic baby foods is one category doing extremely well," Huddleston said, citing both nonrefrigerated versions and a new frozen line of certified organic baby foods. The New Organics Co. based in Massachusetts has also been gradually capturing space on the canned and packaged grocery aisles of many area supermarkets. Winn-Dixie Texas based in Fort Worth, for example, is stocking New Organics mustards, preserves and other canned and packaged foods in 45 of its 73 Texas and Oklahoma stores, said Pat West, Winn-Dixie's regional marketing director. MORE nn The surge of organic foods into mainstream markets in North Texas can be explained in large part because of increasing numbers of suppliers: more demand, more supply. Overall, more and more categories of organic and natural foods are becoming widely available, said Jeff Lang, Albertson's North Texas Division grocery sales manager. Less than three years ago, Albertson's "organic" merchandising amounted to a few selected stores featuring maybe three to eight certified organic items in 4-foot spaces dwarfed by the produce departments. Today, each Albertson's store _ including 113 in its North Texas Division _ carries a minimum of 25 certified organic produce items, and many locations offer 38 to 45, said Gary Barnett, the division's produce sales manager. Those items are dispersed throughout the produce department rather than being relegated to a solitary corner. In fact, all of Albertson's organic items are scattered throughout the store rather than being segregated into an organics section, flagged by signs identifying them as organic. Minyard's White notes that his stores are just beginning to show a similar burgeoning variety of whole foods. Although supply and demand vary widely from store to store, some locations in the Minyard chain carry as many as 30 to 40 certified organic produce items, as well as increasing organic options in canned, frozen and dairy foods. The grocer, based in Coppell, Texas, is even stocking some organic produce that has yet to turn a profit. "We're looking toward the future," White said of the chain's commitment to organic growth. Which seems fairly natural. _ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide Web: www.star-telegram.com) &QL; nn
