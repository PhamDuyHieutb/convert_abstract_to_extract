WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government today released new national standards for growing and processing organic food that will bar the use of genetic engineering or irradiation. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the standards, which are expected to go into effect later this year, will be the "most comprehensive, strictest organic rules in the world." The rules will allow products that meet the standards to carry a seal of approval that says, "USDA Certified Organic." USDA first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the organic industry strongly objected to provisions that could have allowed the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, as well as genetically engineered and irradiated ingredients. The new rules, which will replace a hodgepodge of state and private standards, also would prohibit the use of antibiotics in livestock production and require the use of organic feed. Enforcement of the standards will be left up to states and private certifying agencies. Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic, only 6,600 are certified by a state or private agency. Nineteen states have no regulations for organic farming. Eleven others, including California, have production standards but no certification process for ensuring that farmers comply with them. ------ On the Net: http://www.usda.gov
