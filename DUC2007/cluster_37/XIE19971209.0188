BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in building and utilizing a robot recently to survey Pacific Ocean depths of 6,000 meters, according to today's "Economic Information Daily." The robotic accomplishment represents an advanced level in this high-tech sector, experts said. Exploration of the ocean floor at 6,000-meter depth has sparked fierce competition among nations. Survey technology at such depths -- considered by some to be more sophisticated than space technology -- must cope with atmospheric pressure 600 times that at sea level. In addition, oceanic research robots must adjust to unexpected problems. The China-made robot completed its deep-water video record, measurements of the ocean bottom, investigation of water conditions and search for missing objects while automatically recording data, according to the report. A special group of experts for the robot project also expressed satisfaction with the cable-less robot's quality and reliability.
