CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's children have enrolled in an exclusive South Florida private school and he asked the media to leave them alone. Standing on the driveway of Gulliver Academy, Simpson said Thursday he's proud that his 14-year-old daughter, Sydney, and 12-year-old son, Justin, passed the school's rigorous entrance exams and are beginning classes. They were not present at his news conference. The academy charges $13,000 annually, has an average class size of 14 students and sends almost all of its graduates to college. The children of Gov. Jeb Bush and singers Julio Iglesias and Gloria Estefan have attended the school. "My major concern was the education of my kids," Simpson said. "The two key things to raising kids is to make sure that they know they are loved and make sure that they got a first-class education." Simpson, 53, has had custody of his children for four years, since shortly after he was acquitted of murdering their mother -- his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson -- and her friend Ronald Goldman. A civil jury later found him responsible for their 1994 deaths, awarding their families $33.5 million. Simpson said he's in the middle of moving from Los Angeles to South Florida, renting a house for now in an undisclosed location. He said he is seeking a home near the school.
