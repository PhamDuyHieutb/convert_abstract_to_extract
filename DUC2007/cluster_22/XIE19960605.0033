WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Republicans in the U.S. Congress have been blocked by Democrats in their efforts for a legislation to deploy a nationwide ballistic missile defense system by 2003, Congress sources said today. By a party-line vote of 53-46 Tuesday, the U.S. Senate fell short of the votes needed to end a Democratic filibuster against the missile defense legislation sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. A total of 60 votes were needed to end the debate and bring on a vote on the Defend America Act calling for the deployment of the defense system. Republicans argued during the Senate debate that a national missile defense system is needed now because of the growing threat of missile attacks on the U.S. targets. But Democrats expressed their support for the U.S. administration's stance on the issue. President Bill Clinton has said that he favors a national missile defense but does not believe that the system should be deployed now because the threat of missile attack is remote. Democrats said that the missile defense system would be too costly and undermine the strategic arms treaties with Russia. A recent Congressional Budget Office study estimated that the missile defense system would cost as much as 60 billion U.S. dollars at its first stage. The estimate has prompted the House Republican leaders to pull their version of the bill, sponsored by House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the United States and Russia are limited to build a single ballistic missile defense system. Russia has deployed its system around Moscow. The United States has no defense against a long-range missile.
