ATLANTA (AP) -- The investor who killed his family and nine people at two brokerage firms vowed in a note to kill "the people that greedily sought my destruction," police said today. Mark O. Barton left the computer-generated note in the living room of his family's apartment in suburban Stockbridge, describing how he killed his wife and two children by hitting them in the head with a hammer Tuesday and Wednesday, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located. The note made no direct reference to Thursday's slayings at the two brokerage firms in Atlanta, except the reference to greedy people. "I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to kill ... the people that greedily sought my destruction," he wrote. Barton wrote that he killed his children -- 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle -- to spare them the pain of living without parents. Using a hammer "just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die," he wrote. "There was little pain. All of them were dead in less than five minutes." Barton also expressed regret for killing his 27-year-old wife, Leigh Ann, "my honey, my precious love." "I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for my demise as I planned to kill the others. I really wish I hadn't killed her now. She really couldn't help it and I love her so much anyway," he wrote. Barton, 44, killed himself Thursday evening as police closed in on him in Atlanta's northern suburbs about five hours after the shootings in Atlanta. Thirteen people were injured at the two brokerage firms, some by bullets and others by their frantic attempts to avoid the killer. Four remained in critical condition today. Six years ago, Barton was a suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother, authorities said. But Mercer said Barton's note denied responsibility for those slayings and wrote, "There's no reason for me to lie now." Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day trader, an investor who attempts to profit from moment-by-moment changes in the stock market, a risky trading method. The shooting rampage -- the third in the Atlanta area in little more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 3.1 million and quickly captured national attention. It was the latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed. Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when he walked into the Momentum Securities day trading firm in the Two Securities Centre building about 3 p.m. Thursday. Four people were dead within minutes. "I saw a lot of blood in the hallway," said Chris Carter, 32, who works on the building's third floor. "There was a trail of blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other." Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont Center. Five died there. Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, "made comments to the extent that it was a bad trading day and something to the effect that it was going to get worse," Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said today. He had been a customer of both firms. Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting at her computer when she heard shots. "I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the first person to look into his eyes," Ms. Jones told WSB-TV. "He was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings. The bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I was able to escape," 	For hours, the mayor and police did not know where Barton was and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look for him. Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the doors; some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the shootings. "We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded ourselves in," said Morgan Lyle, 51. "We had no idea what was going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm." Barton's unoccupied minivan was eventually spotted by security guards at Town Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, said Cobb County police Cmdr. D.E. Cook. Around the same time, Barton approached a woman in the parking lot and attempted to take her vehicle, telling her he would shoot her if she screamed, he said. "She was able to run away and contact security," police spokesman Dana Pierce said today. Barton returned to his van and police began following him north on Interstate 75. The rampage ended when Barton shot himself as police cornered him at a service station in Acworth, 30 miles northwest of Atlanta and roughly five miles from the mall. "He was pulled over, and then killed himself," Mayor Bill Campbell said. Ms. Harvard said two weapons, a 9 mm Glock and a .45-caliber Colt, and a duffel bag full of ammunition were recovered from Barton's van. The Glock was registered to Barton, who bought it in 1993, but the Colt was registered to someone in Texas, and "we are not sure why or how Mr. Barton came into possession," she said. Barton's first wife -- the mother of the children who were slain this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. "He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was," said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the killings. Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks, Campbell said. "He had swings up and down," said the mayor. "He apparently was concerned about losses, at least expressed that." All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in equity to open an account. To cope with the stress, the company employs a psychotherapist to help traders. This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were open. Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers -- red carnations, yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card that said, "I'm so sorry. God bless you." At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked outside. "In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual," said Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed. "Unfortunately true."
