WASHINGTON _ In June, just as the Democratic presidential primaries were nearing an anticlimactic end, the Clinton-Gore administration boasted of its successes in advancing the political standing of women since the U.N. conference on women's rights in Beijing five years ago. But thus far in his very private process of selecting a running mate, Vice President Al Gore has given few hints that he is ready to do just that by selecting a woman for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket this year. This week, as he began to narrow the number of vice presidential candidates, Gore suggested that his long list included women, though he was not specific. "I think it's only fair to the men and women involved to keep it private and dignified," he said of his selection process. But hardly any of the news accounts of Gore's selection process speculated on the possibility of the vice president selecting a woman. Most of the speculation centered on Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tom Harkin of Iowa, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. But what about a woman? Is it possible that Gore is haunted by the ghost of 1984, when Vice President Walter Mondale picked a little-known New York congresswoman, Geraldine Ferraro, and went on to the greatest defeat in modern American politics? "I don't think that has anything to do with it," said Marla Romash, a longtime political associate of Gore. "It's more about numbers than anything else. There just aren't that many women to choose from." Indeed, the ranks of Democratic female politicians are so thin that noted Democratic pollster Celinda Lake has reached into the ranks of lieutenant governors for a possible running mate for Gore. Admittedly, Lake's candidate is no average lieutenant governor: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy. But the vice presidential selection process of both Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee, has generally rankled people who had hoped to see more of a female presence. "It just shows once again that women have an uphill battle in politics as in any other field dominated by white males," said Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey. It is the same for women worldwide. When it comes to a "gender balanced" presidential ticket, "The political parties like to talk about viability _ or lack of it," added Hawkesworth. "But the fact is, there are plenty of women who would be viable candidates." Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, who served in the last two Republican Cabinets, was widely touted as a possible Bush running mate. But the governor chose oil industry executive Dick Cheney, a former congressman and secretary of defense. As Gore coasted to victory in the Democratic primaries this spring, generating a guessing game about a running mate, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California was mentioned frequently. A seasoned politician and one of the best speakers in American politics today, Feinstein has a generally _ but not uniformly _ liberal voting record. But Feinstein is up for re-election this year. And she is from a state that Gore could win this fall without her help. In addition, she voted against NAFTA, one of the administration's major accomplishments, and was among the first Democrats to condemn President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. "Gore's biggest problem (in selecting a female running mate) is the size of the pool," said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Clarement-McKenna College in California. Democratic women account for just six senators, 39 House members and one governor, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Like Feinstein in the Senate, 37 of the 39 House members are up for re-election _ two are leaving the House. Shaheen also is seeking another term. The six Democratic senators average 19.8 years each in politics, topped by Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, 27 years; Feinstein, 26 years; and Barbara Boxer of California, 24 years. The six men most mentioned as possible Gore running mates average 22.3 years each in politics, with Graham at the top, 34 years, and Gephardt, 29 years. Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Louise Slaughter of New York are the Democratic women who have served the most consecutive years in the House: Kaptur, 18, and Slaughter, 14. But neither has been mentioned as a possible running mate. Neither have Clinton Cabinet members Donna Shalala, Alexis Herman or Janet Reno. (Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is barred by the U.S. Constitution from running because she was not born in the United States.) "Gore's choice has to be perceived by most voters as presidential," said Joel Goldstein, author of "The Modern American Vice Presidency." Added Romash: "You don't get on the list in a vacuum; you get on the list by having years of experience in public service. And we're still working to increase the number of women available to be on the list."
