WASHINGTON _ Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer announced Thursday they will wield gavels during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month as the first two women co-chairs of a national political convention. Feinstein and Boxer, both California Democrats, will make opening remarks at the convention, which begins Aug. 14th and preside over votes and official business from the dais. The two women previously chaired Democratic conventions as single chairpersons. In 1992, Democrats chose Texas Gov. Ann Richards to chair their New York convention and in 1984, Gov. Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky was selected as the chair of the convention held in San Francisco. Feinstein said the convention would shine a spotlight on the fact that California _ the largest state in the country with 34 million people _ has elected two women senators. "This shows the openness of the party to women," Feinstein said in an interview. Boxer recalled watching Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., on the dais at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York when she nominated Al Gore as vice president. At the time Mikulski was the only Democratic woman senator who hadn't been appointed to fill a position. The Senate now has nine women: Feinstein, Boxer, Mikulski and Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, Patty Murray, D-Wash, and Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both Maine Republicans. Boxer and Feinstein were both running for Senate seats in 1992 and both spoke at the convention that year. "It was an amazing experience," Boxer recalled. Feinstein won her election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when he resigned his Senate seat to become governor. Boxer also won her election, succeeding the retiring Alan Cranston. "Now we've made history together as the first women co-chairs of the convention, so this is a wonderful moment," Boxer said. The Democratic National Committee also announced Thursday that California Gov. Gray Davis will serve as the convention's honorary chair. &UR; &LR; &QL; (Judy Holland can be reached at 202-298-6920 or at the e-mail address judy &LR; hearstdc.com).
