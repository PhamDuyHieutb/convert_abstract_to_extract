WASHINGTON _ California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose decision not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her plans for re-election to the Senate. The Democratic senator said Thursday that she will seek re-election in 2000, and will begin the effort later this month with a fund-raiser in San Francisco. "The reason I didn't run for governor is that I want to continue in the Senate," Feinstein said Thursday in an interview. "I believe I can continue to be effective in the Senate." After three statewide campaigns in the 1990s, the 64-year-old former San Francisco mayor has become one of the most recognized and popular politicians in the state. Feinstein is frequently mentioned as a potential running mate for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000. "I'm not planning on that happening. . . . It's not a possibility at this stage," Feinstein said. "At this point, everything in me is going to work toward continuing in the United States Senate." Although no Californian has ever done it, state election officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at the same time. Were she to win both elections, Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary replacement until voters elect a successor. Democrats, bolstered by their strong showing in last month's elections, believe they have a chance to regain control of the Senate in 2000. Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 advantage, but Democrats hold fewer of the seats up for re-election. Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 and has earned a reputation as a no-nonsense centrist who works well with Republicans as well as Democrats. Her fiercest critics have been civil libertarians, who have decried her efforts to restrict information on the Internet (ranging from the dissemination of personal data to instructions on how to build bombs) and gun advocates, who oppose her ban on assault weapons, which was passed in 1994. Several Republicans have expressed an interest in the seat, including Rep. Chris Cox, R-Newport Beach, who recently transferred campaign contributions into a Senate campaign account in order to keep his options open. Other Republican candidates mentioned as possible contenders include Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., California Secretary of State Bill Jones and State Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. Multimillionaire Al Checchi, who made a bid for the Democratic nomination for governor earlier this year, laid to rest rumors that he might be interested in challenging Feinstein in the Democratic primary. "I don't want to be senator," Checchi said Thursday from his Los Angeles home. Feinstein estimated that she will need to raise at least $15 million to defend her seat, and will begin the process with a women's event in San Francisco later this month. Large fund-raising events are being planned for both San Francisco and Los Angeles early next year. Feinstein has enlisted the help of longtime political advisers Kam Kuwata and Bill Carrick. In a move that may boost her chances for re-election, Feinstein has reclaimed her seat on the influential Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees $1.5 trillion in annual discretionary spending. Two years ago, Feinstein gave her seat on the committee to Sen. Barbara Boxer as a way to help her fellow California Democrat's chances for re-election. Boxer used the position to help lobby for _ and then boast about _ tens of millions of dollars for California projects including BART, the Presidio and preservation of San Francisco Bay. Boxer will now take Feinstein's seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Discussing her priorities for the next Congress, Feinstein said she will push for the construction of new schools and work to discourage the practice of "social promotion," in which students are moved from grade to grade without any testing of their skills. She also said she will revisit the issue of guns and may introduce legislation to require child safety locks, regulate "Saturday night specials," and close a loophole in the assault weapons ban that permits the import of large bullet clips. The Senate may be consumed with a trial of President Clinton if the House approves articles of impeachment later this month, an ordeal that she complained is evolving into "Melrose Place on Lafayette Park." Feinstein initially issued an angry rebuke of Clinton after he admitted to deceiving the nation about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Now, although open to a resolution to censure the president, she has "not seen anything" to make her think Clinton should be removed from office. "I think it's extraordinarily important that this chapter be closed. I think worldwide the United States looks worse and worse." Feinstein will have a good opportunity to gauge the president's reaction to the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry. She has accepted a White House invitation to accompany Clinton on a trip to the Middle East on December 12, the day the House Judiciary Committee is expected to complete its impeachment proceedings.
