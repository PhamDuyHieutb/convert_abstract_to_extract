Japan Marks Subway Nerve Gas Attack 	TOKYO (AP) -- Station employees bowed their heads in prayer and victims' relatives placed flowers on subway platforms today in ceremonies marking the fourth anniversary of the deadly nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subways. At a station in central Tokyo, 30 subway workers and a dozen victims' relatives gathered and offered their prayers at 8 a.m. local time -- the time that members of the Aum Shinri Kyo doomsday cult released the poisonous gas on five Tokyo subway lines in 1995. Twelve people were killed and 5,300 were injured in that attack. America West Dodges Major Strike 	PHOENIX (AP) -- In last minute negotiations, flight attendants and America West Airlines have reached a contract agreement. The move ends a four-year fight over pay that brought the airline to the brink of a strike. The 2,300 flight attendants were free to strike after 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, but three days of talks with federal mediators in Washington resulted in a settlement. A possible strike threatened to leave up to 100,000 passengers stranded this weekend. Global Balloonists Sail Over Africa 	GENEVA (AP) -- GENEVA (AP) -- Two adventurers neared North Africa early today and their dream of becoming the first people to circumnavigate Earth nonstop in a balloon. Near exhaustion on the 20th day in their shiny red capsule hanging from a massive silver balloon, Brian Jones of Britain and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland faced the decision of crossing the finish line and touching down soon after, probably in Mali, or riding the jet stream hundreds of miles farther to a more dramatic landing near the pyramids in Egypt. Peace Monitors Depart Kosovo 	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International monitors sent here five months ago to shore up a failed cease-fire were leaving Kosovo Saturday, while a determined NATO and defiant Serbs geared up for a showdown over the future of this rebellious province. Meanwhile in Washington, President Clinton warned that the collapse of peace talks in Paris had raised the stakes and "if we and our allies don't have the will to act, there will be more massacres." NATO has threatened massive airstrikes against Serb-led Yugoslavia if President Slobodan Milosevic does not accept a peace plan providing for sweeping autonomy for Kosovo and NATO troops to police the accord. Train Crash Investigation Ending 	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators are wrapping up their work at the site of a deadly Amtrak train-truck accident. Officials have released a list of the eleven people who were killed in Monday night's collision between a truck and the train. The question of when the truck driver entered the track crossing remains unanswered. National Transportation Safety Board investigator J.S. Dunn said "a number of people" claiming to have witnessed the crash that killed 11 had come forward and that their stories would be checked. Greece Considers Oscar Winner 	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greeks who succeed abroad usually find their greatest admirers back in their ancestral home -- Elia Kazan gets a very different reception. The filmmaker son of Greek-American immigrants won't receive much applause when he receives a lifetime achievement Academy Award on Sunday -- his third Oscar. Kazan, 89, won Oscars for "Gentleman's Agreement" in 1947 and "On the Waterfront" in 1954. But many Greek artists and others refuse to forgive Kazan's decision to identify Communist Party members in Hollywood during the "blacklist" hearings in Washington nearly 50 years ago. Dow Closes Week at 9,903.55 	NEW YORK (AP) -- A poor showing for the bluest of the blue-chip stocks dragged the Dow Jones industrial average lower Friday, ending its strongest run yet past 10,000. The Dow fell 94.07 to close at 9,903.55 and the Nasdaq finished at 2,421.49, down 41.47. Graf Beats Capriati at Lipton 	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Two comebacks collided Friday, as Steffi Graf showed no mercy with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Jennifer Capriati in the second round at the Lipton Championships. "That's the best she's ever played against me," Capriati said. The 29-year-old Graf, slowed by injuries for much of the past two years, is seeking her first tournament title since November. Based on Friday's performance, she's a threat to upstage such youngsters as Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters. Islanders End Winless Streak 	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Rookie Mike Watt scored the go-ahead goal as the New York Islanders snapped an eight-game winless skid with a 3-1 win against the Vancouver Canucks on Friday night. Mark Lawrence and Bryan Smolinski, who sealed the win scoring with 2:03 left, also scored for the Islanders in a battle of last-place teams. AP NewsBrief by DAN BOYLAN
