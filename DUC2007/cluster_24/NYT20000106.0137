WASHINGTON _ Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop launched an Internet site Thursday to help overweight people "lose weight in a healthy manner and keep off the pounds for good." "At a time when obesity is escalating to epidemic levels, it is important to reach Americans with solution-oriented information on weight control," Koop said at a news copnference to unveil the Shape Up and Drop 10 site (www.shapeup.org). The number of obese Americans has more than tripled since 1991 to 90 million, and recent estimates suggest that obesity-related diseases may cost Americans more than $100 billion annually. For a registration fee of $15 and $10 a week thereafter, adults 18 and over can join the pay-as-you-go program and select a plan that fits their needs. It allows individuals to: _ Set personal weight management goals, including weight loss or prevention of weight gain. _ Choose each day's meal and snack from four types of diets _ basic, non-dairy, lacto-ovo or vegan. _ Control calories both at home and when eating out. _ Choose from five different physical activity plans. _ Determine each week what weight management challenges need to be addressed. The proceeds from Shape Up and Drop 10 will support Shape Up America, a non-profit nationwide network founded by Koop that developed the site, and organizations representing the leading associations in the field of medicine, public health and physical activity. Whatever's left over will be used to underwrite weight loss programs, said Dr. Barbara J. Moore, president of Shape Up America. Moore said people may get better results with Shape Up and Drop 10 than they might get with their personal physicians. "Their personal physicians spend only eight minutes with them (per visit), which is not enough time," Moore said. She added that because physicians can charge as much as $150 per visit, people can't afford to visit their doctors weekly for weight loss tips. Since leaving the surgeon general's office in 1989, Koop has been involved in another Internet venture, drkoop.com, which aides say helps people manage their personal health with comprehensive, trustworthy information. Koop is also the Elizabeth DeCamp McInerny professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. (Story can end here. Optional add follows.) At the same news conference Thursday, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress, promoted her legislation to encourage healthy diets and physical activity. Norton said her $15 million Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise (LIFE) Act, introduced in Congress late last year, is designed to address the 300,000 cases of preventable disease estimated to result each year from unhealthy diets and physical inactivity. "The underlying theme of the bill is that unhealthy lifestyles have gained such a foothold in every part of the country that only major intervention can affect existing runaway patterns in time," Norton said.
